## Functioning

This project uses the __v18.15.0__ of node.js. It works with the __front application__ that you will find by [clicking on this link](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6 "Link of the front application").

### Install
On the directory __backend__, for install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Start
On the directory __backend__, for run:
```
npm start
```

### **IMPORTANT** 

To register a new user, the password must contain at least one lowercase, upper case and number. This is not specified by the front application in case of error despite the fact that I send him a message explaining it. This further enhances user security.

## About

Piquante is a web application that allows you to post your hot sauce and put a "like" on the other posted on the application.

### What does the project consist of?

This project consists in creating a secure API. This will allow you to register and log in with your credentials. Once connected, the user can then post a sauce to himself or put a "like" to another.

### Why do this project?

This project is part of my training as a web developer on Openclassrooms. It allows to evaluate our skills in the realization of a secure API. For this project, the frontend part is already done.
